# Lab - Backlog Planner

One of your instructors - or possibly several - have bought too many video games and can't decide what to play next. Build a web app that should randomly decide what game they will play next, and display it.

## MVP

- Store the list of games in an `ArrayList`, for now.
- Have a route that randomly chooses the next game to be played, and displays it in the browser.


Make sure that you use Velocity to display the result to the user!
