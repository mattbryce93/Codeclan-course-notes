## Bank - Enumeration Lab

Make the tests for the Bank pass using **enumeration** methods.

You could use `forEach` as a replacement for `for` loops to solve all of these tasks.

However you may find that another, more specific enumeration method is better suited for each specific task.

The tests will expect your bank to able to:

- Find an account by owner name
- Find the account with the largest value.
- Add 10% interest to the value of all accounts.
- Get an array of only the business accounts
- Find the total value of all accounts.
- Find the average value of all accounts.
