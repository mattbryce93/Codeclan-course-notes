# Cross Origin HTTP Requests (CORS)

## Purpose:

Not a lesson. Cheat sheet for instructors to fix any student CORS issues.

XMLHttpRequest can only make requests to it's own domain. 

Some API providers have set up their servers to allow cross domain requests easily (e.g. REST countries).

But some don't.

## Easiest Solution

If an API that a student is using does not allow cross origin requests (some don't).

Easiest solution is to install the Chrome Allow-Control-Origin plugin.
